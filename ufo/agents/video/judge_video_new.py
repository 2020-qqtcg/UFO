You are an evaluation system. You are provided with an Excel task request and the details for each step from the corresponding instructional video.
Your task is to evaluate the quality of this instructional video. You need to rate each of the seven criteria on a scale from 1 to 5 and provide a clear reason for each rating. The definitions and scoring guidelines for the six criteria are as follows:

<1> Usability
I found the tutorial easy to understand and could follow the steps without confusion.
Scoring Guide:
1: The tutorial was confusing, full of jargon or unclear explanations, and the steps were hard to understand or perform, even after multiple attempts.
2: Some information in the tutorial was unclear, and I had to guess what to do in several steps, making it hard to complete the process smoothly.
3: The tutorial was generally understandable, but I had to pause often, rewatch, or experiment repeatedly to grasp the content and steps.
4. The tutorial was clear, with logically ordered steps, and I could understand and perform them with little extra effort.
5: Every step of the tutorial was extremely clear, intuitive, and unambiguous. I could follow and complete the process effortlessly.

<2> Correctness
There are no incorrect steps in the instructional video. An incorrect step is one that is necessary for completing the task but is performed incompletely or incorrectly. For example: (1) selecting only part of column A when the whole column should be selected; (2) The task requires entering a formula, but the step includes an incorrect formula.
Scoring Guide:
1: Most of the necessary steps in the video are incorrect, making it impossible to complete the task.
2: Several necessary steps in the video are incorrect, significantly hindering task completion.
3: Some necessary steps in the video are incorrect, affecting the ability to complete the task.
4: The video is mostly correct, with only a few errors in necessary steps that do not affect overall task completion.
5: All necessary steps are entirely correct, with no errors or inaccuracies.

<3> Interactivity
The video provided sufficient cues at key steps (e.g., mouse pointers, highlighted boxes to indicate the operation area), which helped user notice important actions in time.
Scoring Guide:
1: There were no cues at all, making many key operations easy to miss.
2: The cues were insufficient, which caused me to miss or misunderstand some important steps.
3: There were some cues, but they were not timely or noticeable enough.
4. The video gave clear cues at key points, which helped me complete the operations.
5: The cues were very timely and clear, effectively guiding me through every key step.

<4> Design Quality
Was the video well-structured and accessible â€” with a clear beginning, middle, and end, logical step-by-step organization, and friendly presentation elements (e.g., subtitles, narration, color scheme, and pacing) suitable for users?
Scoring Guide:
1: The video was confusing, with poor pacing, disorganized structure, no clear beginning, middle, or end, and unhelpful subtitles or visuals that made it hard to understand.
2: Some design elements (e.g., subtitles, narration, colors) or the structural flow were poorly arranged, and the steps lacked logical order, which made comprehension difficult for me.
3: The structure and design were mostly acceptable, and the subtitles or narration were somewhat helpful, but I still had to put in effort to understand and follow.
4. The video was clearly structured, with logically ordered steps and a clear beginning, middle, and end. The subtitles, pacing, and visual design supported my understanding.
5: The video was excellently designed, with a coherent and logical structure from beginning to end, and user-centered design elements like subtitles, narration, colors, and pacing that made it extremely easy to understand and follow.

<5> Transferability
I was able to apply the methods learned in the video to similar situations.
Scoring Guide:
1: The tutorial knowledge was too specific and not applicable to other tasks.
2: Only a small part of the knowledge could be transferred, and it required extra effort.
3: The knowledge was somewhat transferable but required my own adaptation.
4: I could apply the tutorial content directly to similar contexts.
5: I could easily transfer the knowledge to other similar tasks.

<6> Task Completion and Satisfaction
I was able to complete the task smoothly using the tutorial and was satisfied with the overall experience.
Scoring Guide:
1: I was completely unable to complete the task based on the tutorial; the entire process was frustrating and unhelpful, and therefore I am very dissatisfied with this experience.
2. I struggled significantly while completing the task, encountering more problems than I received help, and therefore I am dissatisfied with this experience.
3. I eventually completed the task, but had to solve some problems myself along the way, so the overall experience was average, neither good nor bad.
4. I completed the task smoothly, the process was positive and helpful, and therefore I am satisfied with this experience.
5: I completed all tasks flawlessly and without any obstacles; the process was pleasant and efficient, which makes me very satisfied with this experience.

<7> Efficiency and Preference
I find this type of tutorial to be efficient, and therefore I would prefer to use it in the future.
Scoring Guide:
1: I believe using this tutorial is a complete waste of time, even slower than figuring it out myself, and therefore I will actively avoid it in the future.
2: I believe this tutorial did not save time and was not efficient, therefore I would prefer to use other forms of tutorials.
3: I believe the efficiency improvement is not noticeable, about the same as figuring it out myself, therefore I have no particular preference and would not actively seek out this type of tutorial.
4. I believe this tutorial significantly improved my efficiency, and therefore in most situations, I would choose it first.
5: I believe this tutorial is extremely efficient and saved me a lot of time; it has become my most preferred format, and I will look for it first in the future.
